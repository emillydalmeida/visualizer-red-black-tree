# PROJECT REPORT: RED-BLACK TREE VISUALIZER

**Project:** Red-Black Tree Implementation and Visualization  
**Language:** Java  

---

## 1. SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY EXPLANATION

### 1.1 Overview
The developed system implements a complete **Red-Black Tree** in Java, providing an interactive interface for manipulation and visualization of the data structure. The Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains its logarithmic height through color-based balancing rules and rotations.

### 1.2 System Architecture
The project is organized into four main classes:

- **Node.java**: Represents an individual tree node with color information
- **Color.java**: Enumeration defining RED and BLACK colors
- **Tree.java**: Implements the Red-Black tree structure and its operations
- **Main.java**: Main interface with interactive menu and visualization

### 1.3 Implemented Algorithms

#### 1.3.1 Insertion
1. Standard BST insertion with RED color assignment
2. Balance fixup through color changes and rotations
3. Enforcement of Red-Black properties
4. Root always maintained as BLACK

#### 1.3.2 Removal  
1. Location of the node to be removed
2. Handling of 3 cases: no children, one child, two children
3. Deletion fixup to maintain Red-Black properties
4. Color adjustments and rotations

#### 1.3.3 Search
1. BST property-guided traversal
2. Efficient O(log n) search complexity
3. Node information display including color and parent

#### 1.3.4 Red-Black Properties Maintained
1. Every node is either RED or BLACK
2. Root is always BLACK
3. RED nodes cannot have RED children
4. All paths from root to leaves contain same number of BLACK nodes

## 3. EXECUTION EXAMPLES

### 3.1 Insertion with Balancing Example

```
=== INSERTION ===
Enter the value to insert: 10

Performing insertion...
Value 10 inserted successfully!
Current state: 1 nodes, root: 10 (BLACK)
==============================

Enter the value to insert: 20

Performing insertion...
Value 20 inserted successfully!
Current state: 2 nodes, root: 10 (BLACK)
==============================

Enter the value to insert: 30

Performing insertion...
Value 30 inserted successfully!
Current state: 3 nodes, root: 20 (BLACK)
==============================
```

### 3.2 Search with Node Information Example

```
=== SEARCH ===
Current state: 5 nodes, root: 20 (BLACK)

Enter the value to search: 25

Performing search...
‚úì Value 25 found!
  Node color: RED
  Parent: 30
```
